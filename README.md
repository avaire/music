## About AvaIre Music

This project has been deprecated with the release of the `--music` flag in [AvaIre](https://github.com/avaire/avaire), you're welcome to try and use this version for self-hosting but you won't receive any support in the support server, nor will this project get any updates to keep up with Discords API or the library API, use this version at your own volition.

If you want to self-host Ava and just use it for music, you can find the project at [github.com/avaire/avaire](https://github.com/avaire/avaire), you just need to start up the jar file using the `--music` flag to disable all the other features.

You can also use the publicly maintained version of Ava and get started using Ava right away by inviting her to your server from here: https://avairebot.com/invite
